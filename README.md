# DEV Together
Final project DCI- Fullstack project: Neha Berlia and Vaia Zymara

### DEV Together provides developers and employers a platform to grow, explore and invest.
## Once registered, as a Developer you can register and update your CV which is then available to registered employers. Employers, themselves can post jobs and contact you or be contacted by developers who have an access to the list of jobs submitted by them in return. 

## The project also has a Developers Community page where once registered users can post blogs as well as have access to events and meets ups (events and meet ups page is still under construction). This feature provides them with a unique opportunity to socialize which we believe is very limited especially when working remote.
